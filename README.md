## Description

The goal of this project is to develop skills in Node.js and Express. It is an individual project completed in 5 days.
A user can go to the app and generate a palette which can then be saved to an existing project. If the desired project hasn't been created yet, it can be created.

## Implementation

Palettes are saved to a posgres database and associated with a project by a foreign key. The posgres database is connected to the Express server with Knex. The front end is build with jQuery.
